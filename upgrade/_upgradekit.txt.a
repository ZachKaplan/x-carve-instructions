<h2><strong>Side Board</strong></h2>

Before getting started, we will remove the drag chain and bracket from the left side of your machine. Start by removing the drag chain from the bracket, so the drag chain can be set to the side while you work.

Next, loosen the M5 x 8mm screws attaching the bracket to the front extrusion. You should be able to loosen the screws enough to slide the bracket out with the pre-assembly t-slot nuts still attached to the screws and bracket. When you’re finished, the bracket should be fully removed from your machine and the drag chain should be detached from the bracket.

Set aside one of the M5 x 8mm screws and one of the pre-assembly t-slot nuts from the drag chain bracket. We will reuse these parts later. 

<img src="jpfs_DSC3452.jpg">

Install all threaded inserts into side board. 

<img src="../jpfs_DSC2932.jpg">
<img src="../P4220538jpg01.jpg">

Assemble frame using the 20mm x 20mm aluminum extrusion, gusset brackets, pre-assembly insertion nuts and M5x10mm button head cap screws. 

<img src="../P4220540jpg03.jpg">

You will want to install two pre-assembly insertion nuts—one from the side board kit and the one from the drag chain bracket—into the long piece of extrusion that will align flush with the edge of your machine (if you’re looking at the front of the machine, this is the length of extrusion on the right side of the side board). There should be one pre-assembly insertion nut on the long piece of extrusion on the left. 

Align the extrusions so the longer pieces are on the inside of the short extrusions. In other words, the outside edges of the long extrusions should align flush with the ends of the shorter extrusions. This photo demonstrates how to line up the extrusions:

<img src="../P4220545jpg08.jpg">

Do not tighten the brackets down all the way. You’ll need to be able to move the extrusions when attaching the board later on in the instructions. 

<img src="../P4220548jpg11.jpg">

Insert two pre-assembly insertion nuts into top track of the short pieces of extrusion at each end of the frame. Next, install the side board to the frame by screwing the M5x12mm button head cap screws into the threaded inserts on the short extrusions. Make sure the spare t-slot nut on the right extrusion is not hidden under the board; it needs to be visible on the track so we can mount the drag chain down when the side board is fully installed.

<img src="../jpfs_DSC2935.jpg">

Install two more pre-assembly insertion nuts into the inside tracks of the short extrusions. These will be used to attach the side board to the rest of the machine using the side board plates.

<img src="../P4220549jpg12.jpg">
<img src="../P4220559jpg22.jpg">


Lift the machine onto the side board and tighten down remaining M5 x 8mm button head cap screws.

<img src="../P4220560jpg23.jpg">
<img src="../P4220563jpg26.jpg">

Now we’ll revisit our drag chain and get it mounted onto the side board correctly. 
Lay the drag chain on top of the long extrusion on the right edge of the side board. You should see your unused pre-assembly insertion nut on the track. Position the pre-assembly nut an inch away from the section of the side board which narrows, as illustrated below. 

<img src="jpfs_DSC3454.jpg">

Snap off the end of your drag chain at this point, so it will align with the pre-assembly insertion nut. 

<img src="jpfs_DSC3449.jpg">

Remove the female end of the drag chain (the end that was previously attached to the bracket at the bottom of the machine) and snap it into place on the drag chain at this shortened length. 

<img src="jpfs_DSC3451.jpg">
<img src="jpfs_DSC3448.jpg">

Use one of the M5 x 8mm button head cap screws we saved from disassembling the drag chain bracket to secure the drag chain to the pre-assembly insertion nut in the side board extrusion. We recommend using the hole on the left side of the drag chain end when tightening to the extrusion, so you do not get unnecessary friction.

<h2><strong>X-Controller</strong></h2>
*****ADD X-CONTROLELR INSTRUCTIONS FROM X-CARVE PAGE****


<h2><strong>Wide MakerSlide</strong></h2>

Note: In these photos, we will be installing the wide MakerSlide on a 500mm sized X-Carve, circa 2015. Some of the exact parts on your machine will be slightly different, but you should still use these instructions to get the general idea of what steps are necessary to swap our your x-axis gantry with the wide MakerSlide rail. 

During this process, you will need access to all sides of your machine in order to install the new wide MakerSlide rail. To make it easier to access all sides of the machine, we have removed our stepper motor wires from the microcontroller and unplugged the DeWalt router from the wall. Make sure you can easily see and access the back of your x-carriage and the two y-plates.

Position your gantry to the very back of the machine’s work area. 

Begin by undoing the stepper motor wiring on the right side of the machine. This is the side of the machine that does not have the y-axis drag chain attached to it. You can undo the bottom terminal block wiring only and leave the stepper motor wiring in place. Undoing this stepper motor wire now prevents your wiring from being damaged during installation of the new rail.

Once the stepper motor wire is removed, pull it through to the left side of the machine. The wire should no longer be through the gantry rail or right y-axis plate.

<img src="P9210355.JPG">
<img src="P9210356.JPG">
<img src="P9210360.JPG">
<img src="P9210361.JPG">

Next, remove your drag chain bracket from the x-carriage. You can leave the bracket attached to the bottom of the drag chain. Set aside these screws and save them for when we reassemble everything. 

<img src="P9210346.JPG">
<img src="P9210348.JPG">

Once the drag chain bracket is removed, it’s time to undo the belting from the right side of the machine. This is the same side of the machine where we undid the wiring. Remove the belt clip and screws from the belt; set them aside for later. 

<img src="P9210351.JPG">
<img src="P9210349.JPG">
<img src="P9210352.JPG">

Before advancing, find a way to prop up the MakerSlide rail on the right side of the machine. If you have a 1000mm machine, we suggest having someone else help with this part of your installation. We used an old NEMA 23 stepper motor module box to support our gantry and spindle, but feel free to use anything that will keep the rail level when we start disassembling the gantry. 

<img src="P9210358.JPG">


Once your rail is fully supported, start removing the four button head cap screws securing the gantry rails to the right y-axis plate. Set these aside for later. Your rail should safely rest on the box you put into place. 

<img src="P9210357.JPG">

You should now be able to safely slide the right y-axis plate towards the front the machine. You may need to wiggle the rails slightly to get the plate fully moved away from the rails. Push the y-axis plate all the way to the front of the machine so you have space to remove the x-carriage.

<img src="P9210362.JPG">
<img src="P9210364.JPG">
<img src="P9210365.JPG">

Undo the screws holding the belt clip in place on the left side of the machine. The belt should now be detached from both y-axis plates, but still threaded properly over the pulley on the x-carriage. This way, when you replace the x-carriage back on the new rail, you don’t need to re-thread the belting back over the pulley. 

<img src="P9210369.JPG">
<img src="P9210370.JPG">

If possible, use two people for this next part. 

Slide the x-carriage all the way to the right side of the machine. Reposition your box to the other side of the x-carriage, so when you remove the x-carriage completely the rails will still be supported by the box. 

<img src="P9210371.JPG">

When you’re ready to slide the x-carriage all the way off the gantry, make sure you clear the y-axis rails and don’t damage the wiring on the back of the x-carriage gantry. Try to keep the belting from being damaged inside the x-carriage as you slide the carriage off the rails. Make sure the belting stays draped over the pulley once the carriage is off the rails.

<img src="P9210373.JPG">
<img src="P9210374.JPG">

When you are finished, your machine should have the x-carriage and belting removed. The gantry should only be held in place on the left side of the machine and the box on the right side of the machine. From the front of your machine, it should look like this:

<img src="P9210375.JPG">

Make sure you remove the two pre-assembly t-slot nuts from the gantry. You’ll need to reinstall them on the new rail.

<img src="P9210376.JPG">

Next, remove the four screws holding the rails in place on the left side of the machine. You will need to hold the last rail with your hand while you unscrew the final screw. 

<img src="P9210377.JPG">
<img src="P9210378.JPG">

When you are finished with this step, your two gantry MakerSlide rails should be completely removed from the machine. The top drag chain will also be removed from the machine.

<img src="P9210379.JPG">

Ok, we’re halfway through! Now, it’s time to get your new wide MakerSlide rail. Make sure to position it so the X-Carve logo is on the right side of your machine, facing the front of the machine. The two grooves on the MakerSlide should be on the top and back of the rail if you are viewing the machine from the front.

<img src="P9210380.JPG">

We are going to assemble the new gantry in the reverse way that we disassembled it. We are going to start with the left side of the machine first. Align the rail with the same holes on the left y-axis plate from which we just removed the old gantry screws. You can use the same box to hold the new rail in place while you screw in the new MakerSlide rail. 

<img src="P9210381.JPG">
<img src="P9210382.JPG">

Make sure you install the drag chain bracket to the left y-axis plate using the back two screws on the rail. 

<img src="P9210383.JPG">

Now it’s time to add the x-carriage back onto the gantry. Align the V-wheels on the new rail. If possible, align the belting underneath the smooth idlers as you slide the carriage back onto the rail. This way the belting is in place and ready to do when the carriage is all the way on the rail. 

Make sure the spindle is facing the front of the machine. 

<img src="P9210385.JPG">
<img src="P9210386.JPG">
<img src="jpfs_DSC3444.jpg"
<img src="jpfs_DSC3453.jpg"

Slide the x-carriage onto the rail and move it far enough onto the rail so you can position the box underneath the rail on the right side of the machine, where the gantry is not secured to the plate yet. 

<img src="P9210389.JPG">

Before we forget, let’s add in the pre-assembly t-slot nuts to the top of the wide MakerSlide. Remember to insert them with the protruding part pointing down, so the flat part of the nut is on the top of the rail. 

<img src="P9210400.JPG">

Next, thread the right y-axis stepper motor wire back through the gantry. Be careful not to damage the ends of the wire when inserting in through the MakerSlide. <strong>Do not pull the wire all the way through the MakerSlide.</strong> Position the end of the wire so it is flush with the end of MakerSlide rail. To make this next part easier, we suggest taping the ends of the wiring so you can thread it through the plate easier.

Slide the right side y-axis plate into place near the wide MakerSlide. Try aligning the wire with the oblong shape on the y-axis plate.

<img src="P9210392.JPG">
<img src="P9210393.JPG">

This next part is tricky. Again, we recommend taping the ends of your wiring to make it easier to thread the wires through the holes on the plate (the photos do not reflect this). 

Position the right y-axis plate so the holes line up with the holes on the plate. You can try to push the wires through the oblong hole, but you will likely need a pair of tweezers to pull the wires through the plate. If you have taped the ends of your wires, it should be easier to grab the wires and pull them through. Be gentle so you don’t damage the insulation on the outside of the wires. 

<img src="P9210396.JPG">
<img src="P9210397.JPG">

When the wire is fully through, check the insulation for any damage. Wrap any exposed wires with electrical tape so you don’t have a faulty connection. Rewire your stepper motor with the same configuration as before: match red to red, white to blue, green to green and black to black.

<img src="P9210398.JPG">

When the wiring is complete, secure the new wide MakerSlide rail in place using the four button head caps screws from the original rails. 

<img src="P9210399.JPG">

The rail is now installed! You can remove the box supporting the underside of the rail. 

Next, we need to reinstall the belting. Start on the left side of the machine, and install the left belt clip. When inserting the shorter screw into the t-slot nut, don’t tighten it down all the way. The t-slot nut should still be able to move once the screw is installed partway. 

You should not install the Nylock nut so both the head of the screw and the nut are flush on either side of the plate. The nut will be used for adjusting the belt tensioning after the machine is fully assembled, so we will want to make sure we can adjust the tension as necessary. The nut should be flush against the outside of the plate, but the head of the screw should still have space before the edge of the plate.



Your belting should still properly installed on the pulley. Take the time to make sure it is positioned properly underneath both smooth idlers before continuing.

Working on the right side of the machine, install the smaller screw on the bottom part of the belt clip partially into the pre-assembly t-slot nut on the rail. The screw should be secured in the t-slot nut but you should still be able to slide the belt clip. Next, insert the longer screw into the hole on the right y-plate. Tighten the nylon locking nut on the long screw from the other side of the y-plate. Once the screw is tightened flush to the y-axis plate, finish tightening the smaller screw into the t-slot nut so the clip is fully secured.

<img src="P9210402.JPG">
<img src="P9210404.JPG">

The final step is reattaching the drag chain bracket to the x-carriage. Use the original screws to reattach the drag chain bracket to the x-carriage. 

<img src="P9210405.JPG">
<img src="P9210406.JPG">

Before operating your machine again, make sure you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0HRqtWj0qM&feature=youtu.be">check your belt tensioning using this video</a>. You should be able to use the screw and nylock nut on the left side of the machine to properly set the belt tension.

Congratulations! Your new wide MakerSlide is now fully installed!


<h2><strong>Z-Probe</strong></h2>

Installing your z-probe will be different depending on if you have a hole on the upper right corner of your x-carriage or not. Before starting, check to see if your x-carriage has this hole or not. The instructions are essentially the same for both x-carriage types, but there are some differences. 

First, make sure you have everything in your kit. 

<img src="P9210409.JPG">

Start by threading the long black wire through your drag chain. You will want to the end with the connection to be near the x-carriage: 

<img src="P9210410.JPG">

The end with the black and red wires to end up near your X-Controller:

<img src="P9210411.JPG">

Threading the wire through the drag chain can be difficult to do, and we advise being patient if you opt to thread the wire in with your other components. It is easiest to thread the end with the connector through the drag chain, but this part of the wire won’t go through the drag chain that runs alongside the left side of your machine. We will need to thread the left y-axis drag chain with end of the wire that is split into the black and red wire. 

Start by threading the connection end of the black wire through the top drag chain.

<img src="P9210412.JPG">
<img src="P9210413.JPG">

You will need to wiggle the wire through the drag chain to get it all the way through. When you reach the bend, you may need to move the chain in order to get the connector to fit through. We found that using a screwdriver or tweezers helped move the wire through the chain if it got stuck. 

<img src="P9210414.JPG">
<img src="P9210416.JPG">

Pull the wire through enough to reach the top of the x-carriage, as shown. If you have a hole in the upper right corner of the x-carriage, pull the connector to this hole.

<img src="P9210417.JPG">

Next, we will thread the end with the wires through the drag chain along the left y-axis. The ends of the wire are delicate. To prevent them from being damaged, we suggest taping them so they stay safe while going through the drag chain.

<img src="P9210420.JPG">
<img src="P9210421.JPG">

Again, you might find it helpful to use a tool or tweezer to help the wire through the chain.

<img src="P9210422.JPG">

Once you get the wire through the chain, pull the wire through as much as you can without being completely taut. 

<img src="P9210423.JPG">

If you find it too difficult to thread the wire through the drag chain, you can attach the wire to the outside of your drag chain and secure it with a zip tie. This works the same way as threading it through the chain. 

Here is an example of what we’ve done with the DeWalt power cord:

<img src=18.JPG">

Now it is time to wire the z-probe to the X-Controller. If you taped the end of the z-probe wire to thread it through the drag chain, remove the tape and make sure the wire ends are free of any residue. 

On the back of the X-Controller, look for the “PROBE” terminal port on the back of the machine. It will be on the bottom left side of the panel. 

<img src="P9210424.jpg">

The z-probe’s red wire goes into the “PROBE” terminal port. The black wire goes into the “GND” terminal port to the right of the “PROBE” terminal port. Tighten the screws on the top of the green terminal ports to secure the wires in place. 

<img src="P9210426.JPG">

If you do not have a hole on your x-carriage, your z-probe is installed on your machine. Please skip down to the z-probe computer setup section. 

If your x-carriage does have a hole in the upper right corner, insert the z-probe connection so the threaded connection comes through from the back and sticks out the front of the x-carriage. 

Locate the locking washer in your z-probe kit. 

<img src="P9210428.JPG">

Add this to the end of the connector, from the front of the x-carriage. 

<img src="P9210427.JPG">

Next, thread the nut on top of the washer. You will want to tighten this down with a wrench. 

<img src="P9210429.JPG">
<img src="P9210430.JPG">
<img src="P9210431.JPG">

Great! Now we’re ready to update your computer settings so you can use the z-probe. 

<strong>Z-Probe Computer Set-up</strong>

In order to use the z-probe with Easel, you will need to make sure you are running the correct grbl firmware (1.0c) and that you have the proper Easel driver (0.2.7) installed. 

If you’re using an X-Controller, you’ll will already have the correct grbl firmware installed on your controller board. There is nothing you need to do for this step. 

If you are using a gShield/Arudino motion controller, you will need to <a href="https://inventables.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/2058884?b_id=9562&t=0">re-flash your Arduino board with the latest version of the Inventables grbl fork.</a> 

Once you have the grbl firmware installed, it’s time to download and install the correct Easel local driver. <a href="http://easel.inventables.com/">Go to Easel,</a> and go to the Help > Downloads section. 
 
<img src="Easel screenshot 1 - downloads.png">

Download Easel local 0.2.7 for your operating system.

<img src="Easel screenshot 2 - 0.2.7 version.png">

Make sure you complete the installation on your computer once you’ve downloaded the file. 

<img src="Easel screenshot 3 - open file.png">

Using Your Z-Probe

To use the z-probe wiring harness, plug in the twisted red and black wire into the connector located on your x-carriage. 

<img src="P9210433.JPG">
<img src="P9210434.JPG">

Connect the red wire on the other end of the wiring harness into the z-probe disc. 

<img src="P9210435.JPG">

Attached the clamp to the metal part of your collet or bit. Place the z-probe on top of your material. 

<img src="P9210438.JPG">

Then, when you’re ready to carve, use the Easel carving walkthrough to home your z-probe. Happy carving!
