<h3>Z-Probe Relocation Bracket <em>(Optional)</em></h3>

If you have a Z-Probe connector attached to your X-Axis carriage, You must install a relocation bracket for the connector so that it doesn't interfere with the installation of the arm brackets on either side of the Z-axis makerslide. Start by gathering the relocation bracket, an M5x10mm flat head cap screw, an M5 washer, and an M5 nylon locking nut.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3546.jpg">

Remove the z-probe connector by loosening the thin retaining nut and split ring lock washer from the barrel of the connector. remove from the x-axis carriage. 

<img src="jpfs_DSC3556.jpg">

Align the relocation bracket with the x-axis carriage so that the small hole on the bracket is aligned with the hole for the z-probe on the carriage. The "L" bend should be facing down to provide additional support for the bracket.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3558.jpg">

Insert the M5x10mm flat head screw into the front of the hole in the carriage. Put a washer on the screw, then secure the assembly with the M5 nylon locking nut.

Finally, use the thin retaining nut and thin split lock washer to re-install the z-probe connector on the relocation bracket. You can now proceed with the rest of the installation normally.

<h3>Install Legends On Arm Brackets</h3>

To assist in aligning the two arms that hold the dust shoe itself, we have included two decals to be mounted on the side of each arm bracket. Start by locating both brackets in your kit. They are identical, but will be mounted in a mirrored arrangement upon installation.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3566.jpg">

<img src="jpfs_DSC3567.jpg">

Peel the decals off of their paper backing and apply to the outside edge of each bracket nearest the slotted channel. Try to get consistent alignment with each sticker. They should match with the bracket exactly.

When complete, your brackets should look like this:

<h3>Install Arm Brackets</h3>

Begin by locating the four t-slot insertion nuts in your kit. These have a small, spring-loaded ball bearing to hold them in place while you align them with the brackets. There are two for each side of your z-axis makerslide.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3574.jpg">

Insert two t-slot insertion nuts into either side of your z-axis makerslide

<img src="jpfs_DSC3577.jpg">

Roughly space the two t-slot nuts, and use the holes in the sides of the arm brackets to align them accurately. The bottom of the arm brackets should be flush with the bottom of the x-axis carriage.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3582.jpg">

Align the Arm Bracket so that the inventables Logo is facing down, then secure each bracket to the makerslide with two M5x10mm button head cap screws.

The other side will be mirrored like this:

<h3>Install Dust Shoe Arms</h3>

Locate the two dust shoe arms as well as the clamp screws that go with them. Note that these are mirrored parts and not interchangable with one another. Note the small magnets on the bottom slot of each arm. These align with the magnets in the dust shoe and help to keep it in place.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3595.jpg">

Thread in the clamp screws into each arm. Just a few turns will be fine for now as you don't want to thread them all the way through just yet.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3597.jpg">

Slide both arms into the slots on the brackets.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3598.jpg">

Align the top of each arm with the '0' mark on the legend and secure with the clamp screws.

<h3>Install Dust Shoe</h3>

For your dust shoe to operate properly, you will need to install a small plastic insert on the underside to maintain the proper suction during cutting. This is designed to be replacable so that damage from the bit, collisions, etc. is relatively limited. Begin by peeling the protective backing off of each side of the insert.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3612.jpg">

<img src="jpfs_DSC3614.jpg">

Using four M3x8mm button head cap screws secure the insert to the shoe. The holes for the screws are already drilled and tapped.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3619.jpg">

Slide the dust shoe onto the slots in the two support arms.

<h3>Install Hose Support Pole</h3>

To suspend the vacuum hose, you'll need to install the support pole on the lower right corner of the machine. Begin by locating the pole mounting bracket, one M5x16mm button head cap screw and one M5x12mm button head cap screw.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3626.jpg">

Use a 3mm hex key to remove both the top and the bottom right screw on the lower-right makerslide end plate.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3627.jpg">

<img src="jpfs_DSC3628.jpg">

Align the bracket with the holes on the makerslide end plate. Note that the large hole is designed to clear the head of the middle button head cap screw.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3629.jpg">

Secure the top part of the bracket with the M5x16mm button head cap screw, followed by an M5x12mm button head cap screw on the bottom. You may have to re-align the t-slot nut for the bottom screw.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3632.jpg">

<img src="jpfs_DSC3636.jpg">

Insert the straight section of the pole into the bracket so that the tapered section is pointing up. The pole should free to turn in the bracket so that it can swing back and forth during use. Place a hook around the middle of the pole and secure it with the attached screw.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3639.jpg">

Locate the angled pole and the four remaining hooks. Arrange the hooks as shown.
<img src="jpfs_DSC3643.jpg">

Attach the angled pole onto the straight pole, sliding it into place. clip your vacuum hose onto the hooks, leaving enough slack so that the axes can move freely.

<h3>Install Static Dissipating Band</h3>

The plastic hose indluded with your kit is made of a conductive plastic designed to dissipate static charge built up from material moving through the hose. We recommend grounding the hose to reduce the risk of electrostatic discharge, which can start fires and damage electronics. We include a grounding wire with an aluminum band which can be connected to an electrical ground connection, outlet cover screw, or cold water pipe. First, locate the grounding wire, band, bolt with washer, and nut.

<img src="jpfs_DSC3654.jpg">

Bend the aluminum strap around the hose. Insert the bolt through the round connector on the grounding wire, then insert it through both holes on the aluminum band. Use the washer and nut to secure the band in place. The fit of the band can be fairly tight, so it may be necessary to make sharp bends around the holes in the band. Once the band is installed, you can attach the other end of the wire to a ground connection.

<h3>Install Vacuum Hose Adapter</h3>
Your Kit includes a 2.25" tapered hose adapter for a standard vacuum connection. simply insert the narrow end of the adapter into the and of the hose. The adapter will be held in place by friction alone.
