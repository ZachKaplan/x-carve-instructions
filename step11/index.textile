<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

The drag chain assembly is very similar for the 500mm and 1000mm machines. The main difference is that the drag chain mounts and wraps horizontally on the 500mm machine and vertically on the 1000mm machine. As a result, the brackets that hold the drag chain are a little bit different and mount in slightly different ways.

  <span class="note-text">
    **If you have the 1000mm X-Carve, stop at the point where you've routed your wires through the x-axis drag chain.** The y-axis mounting bracket is installed on the frame of the machine, and the remaining steps are completed in the Work Area section.

You should have two lengths of drag chain, each with one of the male end links removed. Note that it flexes in one direction and is stiff in the other direction.

Take one length of drag chain and snap it into the male end on your X Carriage. It should bend easily around to the left side of the machine. If it does not, unsnap it and flip it around. The 500mm drag chain will bend horizontally toward the back of your machine.

Take all of the wires that will travel with the X Carriage and thread them through the drag chain. It helps to tape the ends together with a piece of masking tape. It's also much easier to thread wires through drag chain when the chain is straight.

h3. Mount Drag Chain Bracket

Attach the bracket you just assembled to the left Y-Plate. You'll back out two of the thread forming screws that hold the X-Axis Makerslide to the Left Y-Plate. Back them out one at a time to install the bracket.

<div class="row image-row">!(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/802/original/0755.jpg?1425059685! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/803/original/0757.jpg?1425059686! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/804/original/0758.jpg?1425059687! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/805/original/0759.jpg?1425059688!

Install this bracket on the front left end plate using the thread forming screws. Again, back out one screw at a time to keep the machine supported while installing the bracket.

Tape the wires that will travel with the Gantry to the bundle of wires that came through the X-Axis drag chain. Thread all wires through the Y-Axis drag chain.

You should have two lengths of drag chain, each with one of the male end links removed. At this time you will be working with only one of the two lengths, and will use the second length during the Work Area section of the instructions.

Note that the drag chain flexes in one direction and is stiff in the other direction. The drag chain will bend vertically around the x-axis motor of your machine. Take the length of drag chain and snap it into the male end on your X Carriage (500mm bracket pictured below). It should bend easily *up and over to the left* side of the machine (pictured at the end of this section). If it does not, unsnap it and flip it around.
