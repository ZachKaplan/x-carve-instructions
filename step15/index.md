### Tuning and calibration

Check out this tuning video to make sure you've got everything assembled and working the way it should.

The video will guide you through squaring your machine, adjusting the v-wheels and adjusting the eccentric nuts.

### Setting Motor Current

Check out this link for information on properly setting the amount of current flowing to your stepper motors. You can do this for all three axes, however it's most important for your y axis as this has two motors sharing one stepper driver chip. The users with NEMA 17s should be fine from the get go, but this is an important step for those with the larger NEMA 23 stepper motors.
