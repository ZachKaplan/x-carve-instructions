Congratulations on assemblying your new X-Controller, now let's put it to use!  

There are two options you can choose to take when putting this on your machine.  Option one keeps your same wiring setup, but requires you to make some changes to the main controller board.  Option two requires a new length of stepper motor cable and takes full advantage of the fourth stepper driver chip.

	<p>This is the easiest and quickest way to get going with your X-Controller.  With this option you won't need to make any changes to your machine, but you will need to change the amount of current running to your y axis to get the most out of your two y motors.</p>

  <h3>Prepare Controller Board</h3>

	<p>As mentioned in the "Install Controller Board":http://localhost:4000/x-controller/#install-controller-board step of the assembly instructions, you'll simply need to increase the potentiometer on your y-axis.</p>

  <h3>Wire Stepper Motor Cable</h3>

	<p>Remove the stepper motor cable from your gShield. Wire the cable into the green terminal block plugs and plug them into the corresponding spots on the X-Controller.</p>

  <p>This option takes a little bit of rewiring, but you end up with each motor getting its own dedicated stepper driver chip.</p>

	<h3>Unwire</h3>

	<p>Start by removing the drag chain end on the left side of the machine to gain access to the terminal block below the stepper motor.  Remove the stepper motor cable from the top screws of the terminal block and separate the two stepper motors.</p>

	<h3>Wire New Stepper Motor Cable</h3>

	<p>Wire the left stepper motor to the left terminal block and completely remove the small length of stepper motor cable that was joining the two y motors.  Wire your new piece of stepper motor cable to the right terminal block.  Route the cable through the drag chain and reattach the drag chain end. Wire the cable into the green terminal block plugs and plug them into the corresponding spots on the X-Controller.</p>

      *Note:* Use tape on your new lenght of stepper motor cable to make it easier to route through the drag chain.

	<h3>Optional Upgrades</h3>

	<p>Limit Switches</p>

	<p>Coolant Controls</p>

	<p>Spindle Control</p>

      *Note: NEVER hook a spindle directly up to the X-Controller.*  These are only control signals, *NOT* power.

	<h3>X-Controller won't turn on.</h3>

	<p>Check to make sure your e-stop button is pulled out and not engaged.</p>

	<h3>Limit switches don't work.</h3>

	<p>Check that the ribbon connectors are fully pushed into the mating connectors.</p>
